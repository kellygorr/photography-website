The intro page, question section, and results page were completely customizable, and options included video backgrounds, different result page layouts, and a vertical button layout.  The text fields for the body copy and buttons were flexible enough to accommodate varying text lengths so that a quiz could be translated into multiple languages without having to adjust the layout.',

Between projects I had built a quiz prototype, and since my team focused on user engagement they recognized it would be a great promotional tool.  GOT was the perfect opportunity to use a quiz, and I was chosen to build it.  I coded the quiz and collaborated with the projectâ€™s designers on the functionality. The quiz was a big success with 90% of users finishing the quiz and over half of those people replaying it.',
